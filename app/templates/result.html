<p>Here's your heatmap! You can download it by pressing the button beneath</p>
<p>Please note that the maximum speed metric may be incredibly large for TCX files: this is to do with the way the TCX reader factors in GPS recalibration, which can make it seem like you have changed your location really rapidly.</p>
<p>The GPX file reader factors out the top 10% of speeds to avoid this error, and the TCX reader is under constant improvement to avoid this in future.</p>
