<p>Your pitch is {{closestDistance}} by {{longSideDistance}} metres</p>
<p>To get the data into a numpy array, you need to rotate the data by {{transformAngle}} radians, or {{angles}} degrees.</p>
<p>The origin of the rotation is {{origin}}</p>

<h3>Why does this page not have a completed heatmap?</h3>
<p>That's the next step. At the moment, I am of the belief that the number of new things learned here, such as 
    asynchronous javascript, google maps API, webpack bundling (with Flask!) and doing trig with downloaded python packages, is sufficient to meet the requirements 
    of the CS50 final project. This will get expanded into a personal project, where I will use numpy and downloaded tcx/gpx packages 
    to iterate through the data and transform point by point to display a heatmap, but there is enough here.
